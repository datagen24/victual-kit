# Prose checks

Vale enforces repeatable parts of Victual's
[documentation conventions](https://github.com/datagen24/victual/blob/master/docs/documentation.md) and
[writing style](https://github.com/datagen24/victual/blob/master/docs/style-guide.md), which
govern this package as well as the server. It uses repository-owned rules and a pinned
Vale binary. No third-party style package or online language service is needed to lint.

The tooling, the fifteen rules and this page are imported from the Victual server's
[`.devtools/vale/`](https://github.com/datagen24/victual/tree/master/.devtools/vale) as of
its `v0.2.0-MVP` release. Keep the two copies in step: a rule change made in one repository
belongs in the other, so the same sentence is judged the same way in both.

The `prose` CI job scans authored documentation on every pull request. It rejects
new findings. This repository started with an empty baseline: the nine findings the first
audit reported were fixed rather than recorded.

## Run locally

Install Python 3 and Git, then run these commands from the repository root:

```sh
python3 .devtools/vale/install.py --directory /tmp/victual-vale
export VALE=/tmp/victual-vale/vale
python3 .devtools/vale/audit.py --output /tmp/prose-audit.json
python3 .devtools/vale/audit.py --check
```

The installer supports Linux, macOS, and Windows on x86-64 and ARM64. On Windows, choose
a local installation directory and set `VALE` to its `vale.exe` path. Only the Linux x86-64
installation and macOS ARM64 installation have been exercised; the other archive checksums are pinned
from the same upstream release.

`install.py` downloads Vale **3.22.0** from its official GitHub release and verifies the
committed SHA-256 checksum before extracting the executable. Installation needs network
access. Subsequent lint runs work offline. An existing Vale installation is acceptable
if its version matches; `audit.py` refuses a different version.

Check selected tracked pages while editing:

```sh
python3 .devtools/vale/audit.py Apps/Victual/README.md --check
```

The audit command exits 0 after producing a report, even when it finds prose problems.
`--check` exits 1 for new findings and 2 for setup failures. Stale baseline entries are reported
but do not fail the check; the scheduled prune on `main` removes them. The JSON report
contains every selected page, including pages with no findings, and the excluded-file list.

## Rules

All fifteen rules live in [styles/Victual](styles/Victual). Length limits are review thresholds,
not automatic rewriting instructions. Fix a passage or explain a narrow exception.

| Rule | Level | What the reviewer checks |
|---|---|---|
| `SentenceLength` | Warning | Sentences over 45 words combine independent claims or hide conditions. |
| `ParagraphLength` | Warning | Body paragraphs over 100 words need separate points or a list. |
| `TableCellLength` | Warning | Cells over 60 words need a concise summary and a link to detail. |
| `Editorializing` | Warning | Replace self-evaluation and metaphors with requirements or evidence. |
| `ReviewNarration` | Warning | State the resulting fact; retain material history in its owning record. |
| `ChatResidue` | Warning | Remove session instructions from durable documentation. |
| `RhetoricalHeading` | Warning | Name the topic or requirement in the heading. |
| `VagueReference` | Warning | Name or link the referenced section. |
| `Wordiness` | Suggestion | Use a shorter expression if its meaning is unchanged. |
| `AssumedEase` | Suggestion | Explain the step or evidence instead of assuming ease. |
| `Metadiscourse` | Warning | Remove speech prefaces, automatic praise, and generic closers. |
| `InflatedSignificance` | Warning | Replace inflated significance and promotional wording with a specific effect. |
| `VagueAttribution` | Warning | Identify the evidence behind an attributed claim. |
| `DecorativeContrast` | Warning | Keep a contrast only when it explains a choice or corrects a stated error. |
| `TrailingCommentary` | Warning | Remove trailing interpretation or state a supported consequence directly. |

Word counts use the rules' word-token expression after Vale parses Markdown. Code spans
and URLs do not contribute to the prose measurement. Table cells have their own length
check and are excluded from sentence and paragraph checks.

Spelling dictionaries, acronym expansion, passive-voice bans, and reading-grade targets
are intentionally absent. They create noise for this technical corpus and do not address
the writing problems that motivated the proposal. Human review still covers document
purpose, duplicated rationale, unsupported claims, and changed technical meaning.

The new phrase checks cover specific recurring expressions. They cannot detect every
maxim, unclear reference, invented term, or claim that gives software human motives.
The checks do not ban articles, continuous tenses, lists of three, or all technical
comparisons. They do not establish formal ASD-STE100 compliance.

## Check commits locally

Install Vale into the ignored local directory and enable the hook once per clone:

```sh
python3 .devtools/vale/install.py --directory .devtools/vale/.bin
git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Check `git config --get core.hooksPath` first if the clone already uses hooks. Preserve
existing hooks by adding a call to `python3 .devtools/vale/check_staged.py` to the existing
pre-commit hook. The local Git setting is shared by linked worktrees.

The hook runs the complete baseline check when staged documentation or Vale tooling
changes. It exports staged pages, rules, configuration, and the baseline to a temporary
directory. Partially staged files are checked exactly as committed. The hook does not
stash files or change the index. Commits without relevant changes skip Vale.

The executable comes from `VALE`, `.devtools/vale/.bin/vale`, or `PATH`, in that order.
A missing executable, a wrong version, or an audit failure blocks the commit. The hook
does not install software or download packages during a commit.

CI runs the same baseline check on committed files. Installing the hook is a local
step; Git does not enable hooks when cloning. Chat replies are outside the Git check
and require self-review against the style guide.

## Scope and protected content

The runner uses `git ls-files` to select maintained Markdown source pages. This includes
`docs/`, the root and application READMEs, the tooling READMEs under `.devtools/`, and
documentation-site source pages. Landed, retired, and superseded documents remain in scope
for editorial review, with their decisions and historical meaning preserved.

These records are excluded from the audit:

- `LICENSE.md`.
- Agent instructions, skills, execution records, and `memory/`.
- `.work/` and archived `docs/plans/.versions/` snapshots.
- GitHub issue and pull request templates.
- Generated audit reports and rule-test fixtures.

The list is the server's, kept identical so the two repositories scope the same kinds of
file the same way.

The exact path list is in each audit's `excluded_files`. Generated documentation and API
reference output are not scanned; scan the authored sources instead.

Vale skips fenced and inline code, URLs, YAML front matter, and blockquotes. Blockquotes
protect recorded `Response` blocks and attributed source text. Keep new explanation
outside the quote; do not move ordinary prose into a blockquote to evade lint.

For a necessary exception, disable only the applicable rule around the smallest passage,
include the reason, and re-enable it immediately:

```markdown
<!-- Keep the formal requirement together to preserve the scope of its exception. -->
<!-- vale Victual.SentenceLength = NO -->
The exact requirement goes here.
<!-- vale Victual.SentenceLength = YES -->
```

## Baseline and rollout

`baseline.json` stores a fingerprint for
each finding, including its path, rule, message, matched text, and source block. It does
not allow a page-wide count that could hide one new problem behind one resolved problem.
Reflowing unchanged prose preserves a fingerprint; changing a flagged block requires
review of its remaining findings.

The workflow runs the rule tests and the complete audit with `--check`. It uploads
the full report even when the baseline comparison fails. New warnings and suggestions
must be fixed or receive a justified rule-specific exception.

**A page cleanup does not edit `baseline.json`.** Fix the findings and leave the baseline
alone. `--check` reports the entries your fix stranded, and the `prose-baseline-prune`
workflow removes them from `main` on a schedule. `prune_baseline.py` does the same thing
locally if you want to see the result:

```sh
python3 .devtools/vale/prune_baseline.py
```

This keeps the baseline out of page branches on purpose. The file is one sorted fingerprint
per line, so two cleanups that delete different nearby keys collide textually even though the
intended result is unambiguous, and a single merge to `main` can re-conflict every open
cleanup at once. Leaving the file untouched removes that contention entirely.

Tolerating a stale entry is safe: it is an allowance for a finding that no longer exists, so
it cannot hide a new one. An unrecognised fingerprint still fails the check.

Adding an entry is a different matter and is never automatic. `prune_baseline.py` only ever
removes; it cannot absorb a new finding. Additions require explicit review, a named issue,
and a documented reason, via:

```sh
python3 .devtools/vale/audit.py --write-baseline .devtools/vale/baseline.json
```
Keep each page's issue open until its findings are fixed or individually justified.

Do not weaken rules to clear the initial backlog. Rule or Vale-version changes need the
fixture tests, a full audit, and review of changes in findings before updating the baseline.
No broad prose replacement is applied automatically.

The workflow runs on pull requests and pushes to `main`; making its check required
for merge is a separate repository setting for the maintainer. The initial audit is a
one-time backlog exercise, not a scheduled issue generator.

## Verify the tooling

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s .devtools/vale -p 'test_*.py'
```

Tests run the actual Vale binary. They check every rule's detection, readable prose,
length boundaries, protected code and quotations, front matter, table scoping, and narrow
exceptions. Baseline tests cover new findings, repeated findings, resolved findings, and
reflow without changing the claim.
Commit-hook tests use temporary repositories and the real Vale binary to check staged
content, partial staging, renames, missing tools, and deletion of baseline findings.
